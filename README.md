# How to use ?

We have hosted all the services, users can simply login to our website and find for themselves our features. Now if you do want to run it locally you have to run all the apps separately.

The process as such is normally what you need to do for standard running of apps locally. However because our product is quite complex so the number of files is quite large so our files have been kept in ZIP format. Do unzip them to run them. As we have written php files for connecting to MySQL database hence you will require software such as xampp for running those specific files.
